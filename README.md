# chrome-tab-archiver
A lightweight Chrome extension that lets you archive the current browser tab into a quarterly-organised bookmark folder in one click or via a keyboard shortcut. It automatically detects or creates your “Archived” root folder, the current `YYYY-Qn` folder (and optional month subfolder), and saves the new bookmark at the top for instant access.
